                        <p>Welcome to Blender, the free and open source 3D creation suite.</p>
                        <p>Blender can be used to create <code>3D visualizations</code> such as still images, <code>3D animations, VFX shots, and video editing</code>.</p>
                        <p>Blender is well suited to individuals and small studios who benefit from its unified pipeline and responsive development
                        process.</p>
                        <p>Blender is a cross-platform application, running on Linux, macOS, and Windows systems. Blender also has relatively small
                        memory and drive requirements compared to other 3D creation suites. Its interface uses OpenGL to provide a consistent
                        experience across all supported hardware and platforms.</p>
                        <p></p>
                            <h4>Who uses Blender?</h4>
                        <p>Blender has a wide variety of tools making it suitable for almost any sort of media production. People and studios
                        around the world use it for hobby projects, commercials, and feature films</p>
                            <h4>Key Features</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Blender is a fully integrated 3D content creation suite, offering a broad range of essential tools, including Modeling,
                                    Rendering, Animation & Rigging, Video Editing, VFX, Compositing, Texturing, and many types of Simulations.</li>
                                    <li>It is cross platform, with an OpenGL GUI that is uniform on all major platforms (and customizable with Python scripts).</li>
                                    <li>It has a high-quality 3D architecture, enabling fast and efficient creation workflow.</li>
                                    <li>It boasts active community support, see blender.org/community for an extensive list of sites.</li>
                                    <li>It has a small executable, which is optionally portable.</li>
                                </ul>

                        <H3>Installing Blender</H3>
                    </header>
                        <p>Blender is released approximately every three months. You can keep up to date with the latest changes through the
                        release notes.</p>
                            <h4>Support Requirements</h4>
                        <p>Blender is available for download on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Always check that the graphics drivers are up to date
                        and that OpenGL is well supported. Blender has a set of minimum and recommended requirements; so make sure these are met
                        before trying to install Blender.</p>
                        <p>Support for other hardware such as graphic tablets and 3D mice are covered later in Configuring Hardware.</p>
                            <h4>Download Blender</h4>
                        <p>Blender offers two different binary packages; you can choose from a stable release or a daily build. The first has the
                        benefit of being more reliable, the latter provides the newest features, as they are developed, at the cost of
                        stability.</p>

                        <p>Here are some preferences that you may wish to set initially. The full list and explanation of the Preferences are
                        documented in the section Preferences.</p>
                            <h4>Language</h4>
                        <p>Enable <code>Edit ‣ Interface ‣ Translation, and choose the Language and what to translate from Interface, Tooltips and New
                        Data</code>.</p>
                            <p>Input</p>
                        <p>If you have a compact keyboard without a separate number pad, enable <code>Preferences ‣ Input ‣ Keyboard ‣ Emulate Numpad</code>.</p>
                        
                        <p>If you do not have a middle mouse button, you can enable <code>Preferences ‣ Input ‣ Mouse ‣ Emulate 3 Button Mouse</code>code.</p>

                    </header>
                    <p>The creation of a 3D scene needs at least three key components: Models, materials and lights. In this part, the first of
                    these is covered, that being modeling. Modeling is simply the art and science of creating a surface that either mimics
                    the shape of a real-world object or expresses your imagination of abstract objects.</p>
                        <h4>Modes</h4>
                    <p>Depending on the type of object you are trying to model, there are different types of modeling modes. Since modes are
                    not specific to modeling they are covered in different parts of the manual.</p>
                    
                    <p>Switching between modes while modeling is common. Some tools may be available in more than one mode while others may be
                    unique to a particular mode.</p>

                        <p>The 3D Viewport is used to interact with the 3D scene for a variety of purposes, such as modeling, animating, texture
                        painting, etc.</p>
